# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-09-19)

**Core value:** Users can reliably learn French through Ealch's lessons and practice — the app must teach correctly and not lose or corrupt a learner's progress, content, or purchased access.
**Current focus:** Phase 1 — Content-Publish Drift Guard Extension

## Current Position

Phase: 2
Plan: Not started
Status: Executing Phase 1
Last activity: 2026-09-19

Progress: [░░░░░░░░░░] 0%

- Average duration: - min
- Total execution time: 0 hours

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| 1 | 4 | - | - |

**Recent Trend:**

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Roadmap: Content scope frozen at A1/A2/exams — no new curriculum levels this milestone.
- Roadmap: Acoustic/phoneme pronunciation scoring and real push-campaign backend both stay out of scope (flagged in research as multi-week efforts disproportionate to a solo-dev launch-readiness pass).
- Roadmap: Phases 14→15→16→17 (snapshot split → cold start → notification tap-handler) form a strict sequential chain because each restructures the same files the next phase touches again; do not parallelize these four.
- Roadmap: Phase 5 (paywall expansion) deliberately sequenced after Phase 4 (entitlement/restore verification) so widening what's gated never outruns the ability to recover access.
- Roadmap (2026-09-19 revision): Original Phase 11 split into Phase 11 (Brix mascot core states: idle/listening/speaking/celebrating/thinking) and Phase 12 (delight states: tap-easter-egg/dozeOff/transform-in-out). All phases after the original Phase 11 renumbered +1 (former 12→13 ... former 18→19), rather than using decimal notation, because decimal is reserved for post-approval urgent insertions per ROADMAP.md's own convention and this split is neither urgent nor an insertion.
- Roadmap (2026-09-19 revision): No mid-milestone launch gate. User explicitly declined a PM/growth-recommended "ship after phase N" checkpoint — this stays one complete milestone, deliberately.
- Roadmap (2026-09-19 revision): Phase 5's specific paywall gating boundary (e.g. "A1 free / A2+exams gated") is deferred to Phase 5's own planning rather than fixed by the roadmap; PAY-02's success criterion now requires Phase 5 planning to determine and document one coherent rule.
- Roadmap (2026-09-19 revision): Phase 13 (UI/UX Polish Audit) is hard-blocked behind Phases 5, 8, 10, 11, and 12 in both its own dependency note and the Progress section's parallel-phases list (previously only the prose note said this, creating a contradiction with the parallel list).
- Roadmap (2026-09-19 revision): Phases 5 and 10 must share one common interruption/nudge visual pattern (upgrade nudge and rating prompt) rather than each inventing its own modal/banner/toast — extending/reusing `PushBanner.tsx` where practical.
- Roadmap (2026-09-19 revision): Phase 10's rating prompt is capped at 3 prompts/user/year on both platforms, matching Apple's `SKStoreReviewController` platform-enforced cap (Android has no equivalent enforced cap, so this is self-imposed there).
- Roadmap (2026-09-19 revision): Phase 9's analytics audit (QA-02) scope expanded to include acquisition/activation funnel events (first-open, signup started/completed, referrer capture, onboarding step-level funnel, D1 return), not just engagement events.
- Roadmap (2026-09-19 revision): Phase 7 re-prioritized internally — BUG-02 (exam response lost on process death) is the phase's highest-priority item (revenue-adjacent, planned/executed first); BUG-01 (audio pause on background) is cosmetic and deprioritized to last. Kept as one phase rather than split, to avoid a second full renumber.
- Roadmap (2026-09-19 revision): Phase 11/12 (mascot) success criteria now explicitly require preserving `MascotAvatar.tsx`'s existing `accessibilityElementsHidden` behavior and `useReduceMotion()` handling in the Rive version, plus a Phase-8-style real-device accessibility re-check specifically for Phase 12's new tap-easter-egg interactive surface.
- Roadmap (2026-09-19 revision): Phase 16 (Cold-Start Lazy Load) reuses the mascot's existing "thinking" state as its loading cue instead of a new spinner, per `MascotAvatar.tsx`'s documented convention; soft (non-blocking) coordination note to visually converge with Phase 11's Rive "thinking" state once that lands.

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Phase 14 (snapshot split design spike) must resolve the manifest backward-compatibility design and `mergeCorpus` multi-overlay question before Phase 15 can be planned — flagged as a research phase, not a standard plan-and-build phase.
- REQUIREMENTS.md's summary line stated "30 total" v1 requirements; the enumerated requirement list actually contains 29 distinct IDs. Corrected to 29 during roadmap traceability update — worth a quick sanity check next time REQUIREMENTS.md is touched.
- ANIM-01 is the one requirement mapped to two phases (11 and 12) rather than exactly one — a deliberate, documented exception from the Phase 11 split, not an orphan/duplicate error. Flag this if any future coverage-validation tooling assumes strict 1:1 requirement-to-phase mapping.
